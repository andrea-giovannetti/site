I am an undergraduate student studying Physics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Before coming to CMU, I attended [Stuyvesant High School](https://stuy.enschool.org/). I am currently advised by Prof. [Tina Kahniashvili](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/kahniashvili.html) in the [Mellon College of Science](https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/). I have worked with Prof. [Roy A. Briere](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/briere.html) (CMU) on experimental particle physics and Prof. [L. Andrew Wray](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/lewis-andrew-wray.html) (NYU) on condensed matter physics. I have accepted my offer to attend CMU for a PhD in Physics starting this fall. 

My research explores how we can utilize the theory of gravitational waves to explore and constrain theoretical cosmology models, like alternatives to general relativity such as massive gravity.

I am originally from South Korea, and grew up in New York City. My parents are from [Jeollabuk-do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Jeolla_Province).
