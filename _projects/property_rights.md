                        <h2>Context</h2>
                        <p>Cities all around the world are characterized by the presence of stable drug markets operated by one or multiple organized crime groups (OCGs). Despite a widely observed geotemporal stability, urban drug markets exhibit a wide heterogeneity in the amount of violence recorded in their geographic surroundings, and little is known about the causes of such heterogeneity.</p>

                        <h2>Aims</h2>
                        <p>The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of two distinct strategies adopted by policymakers around the world for mitigating the spread of online extremism: deplatforming (i.e. targeted surveillance and coercive removal of extremist users) and inoculation (i.e exposing the user base to weakened forms of extremist arguments to build group-wide resilience). Crucially our approach allowed us to evaluate the existence of synergies in the combined use of these policies as opposed to using only one policy.</p>

                        <h2>Methodology</h2>
                        <p>. In this paper we develop a model of rational choice to argue that observed violence  (or its absence) may be a consequence of how OCGs select which markets to target vis-à-vis the choices of other (competing) groups. The core of our argument is that for rational OCGs, a trade-off exists between the profitability of a specific market and the costs involved in a confrontation with incumbent groups..</p>

                        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our model predicts that cities where OCGs are on average more active will jointly feature a more efficient market targeting (as measured in terms of OCG turnover across areas) and lower average amounts of violence. On the other hand, cities manifesting a lower level of OCG activity may show more complex targeting patterns and structural differences between markets. In particular, the model predicts higher OCG concentration, faster turnaround and higher average level of violence in the high-end segment and a relatively more peaceful and disperse control structure for the medium and low-end segment. </li>
                            <li>Equipped with these insights, we review the structure of urban drug markets and OCG-related violence in a large area of U.K, Merseyside (1.4M residents), through a unique dataset containing all OCG-related offenses across years 2015-2018. We show that the structure of drug markets of Merseyside conforms to our model predictions in many dimensions. Particularly, areas characterized by high volumes of drug offenses are characterized by higher OCG turnaround and higher levels of violence as compared to medium volume areas, suggesting an entrenchment effect for groups operating in the latter segment.</li>

                        <h2>Implications</h2>
			<ul>
                        <li>Violence is not necessary a good proxy for OCG activity. In fact, lack of violence in an area might signal the establishment of property rights in that area and, a concern for authorities and general public, the presence of an efficient rent extraction technology being put in place by resident groups. </li>
			<li>Policies homogeneously targeting crime across cities can lead to asymmetries across areas relative to the observed level of violence and the stability of OCG control.</li>

                        <h2>Future Research</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our results pertain the shape of a specific market within a certain temporal snapshot and provide a starting ground for exploring the structure of interconnected markets.</li>
                            <li>The notion of market analyzed in this paper is horizontal. Hence, in future research it will be important  to assess how the relationship between violence and drugs carries over to vertical markets (i.e. supply chains).</li>
