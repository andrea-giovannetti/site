_No institution grants Organized Criminal Groups (OCGs) the right to possess or control a territory. Nevertheless, sometimes these entities find ways to take control of such areas. Using empirical data from Merseyside, U.K., we document the distribution of OCGs' violence and territorial control across the region. We find that OCGs' violence concentrates on the most profitable areas, but surprisingly, no OCG can establish forms of control over those areas. We propose a theoretical model that rationalizes these empirical observations by examining how OCGs strategically select which area to exploit based on profitability and the presence of other OCGs_

                        <h2>Context</h2>
                        <p>Cities all around the world are characterized by the presence of stable drug markets operated by one or multiple organized crime groups (OCGs). Despite a widely observed geotemporal stability, urban drug markets exhibit a wide heterogeneity in the amount of violence recorded in their geographic surroundings, and little is known about the causes of such heterogeneity.</p>

                        <h2>Aims</h2>
                        <p> We review the structure of urban drug markets and OCG-related violence in a large area of U.K, Merseyside (1.4M residents), through a unique dataset containing all OCG-related offenses across years 2015-2018. We aim to supply a theory motivating the observed patterns of drug dealing, violence and turnover between OCGs across areas.</p>

                        <h2>Methodology</h2>
                        <p> We develop a model of rational choice to argue that observed violence  (or its absence) may be a consequence of how OCGs select which markets to target vis-à-vis the choices of other (competing) groups. The core of our argument is that for rational OCGs, a trade-off exists between the profitability of a specific market and the costs involved in a confrontation with incumbent groups. When the cost of exploring areas  is sufficiently high (due, for example, to a vigorous police activity in the streets), each OCG controls one area, while the violence between OCGs remains low across all areas. When the frequency of OCG activity reduces, violent collisions between OCGs only occur in the most profitable areas, while some OCGs control the medium profitable areas. </p>

                        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our model predicts that cities where OCGs are on average more active will jointly feature a more efficient market targeting (as measured in terms of OCG turnover across areas) and lower average amounts of violence. On the other hand, cities manifesting a lower level of OCG activity may show more complex targeting patterns and structural differences between markets. In particular, the model predicts higher OCG concentration, faster turnaround and higher average level of violence in the high-end segment and a relatively more peaceful and disperse control structure for the medium and low-end segment. </li>
                            <li> We show that the structure of drug markets of Merseyside conforms to our model predictions in many dimensions. Particularly, areas characterized by high volumes of drug offenses are characterized by higher OCG turnaround and higher levels of violence as compared to medium volume areas, suggesting an entrenchment effect for groups operating in the latter segment.</li>

                        <h2>Implications</h2>
			<ul>
                        <li>Violence is not necessary a good proxy for OCG activity. In fact, lack of violence in an area might signal the establishment of property rights in that area and, a concern for authorities and general public, the presence of an efficient rent extraction technology being put in place by resident OCGs. </li>
			<li>Policies homogeneously targeting crime across cities can lead to asymmetries across areas relative to the observed level of violence and the stability of OCG control.</li>

                        <h2>Future Research</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our current results pertain the shape of a specific market within a certain temporal snapshot and provide a starting ground for exploring the structure of interconnected markets.</li>
                            <li>The notion of market analyzed in this project is horizontal. Hence, in future research it will be important  to assess how the relationship between violence and drugs carries over to vertical markets (i.e. supply chains).</li>
