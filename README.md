## Hi! 
This is Andrea Giovannetti's Personal Website, you are welcome to download the architecture and work on it yourself, just like I did with Chris Choi's website (https://chrischoi314.github.io/ ), which is based on a clever expansion of the standard Jekyll architecture, featuring a folio blog, automatic BibTeX publication recording and many other features I removed for simplicity. 
On top of the modified expansion, I introduced various HTML snippets, one json automation and a few stylistic touches, mostly collected in the main .css file.
